TODO:

1. Check if both isIncome and category properties are needed as transacion properties or is one enough
2. Finalize design - (mainly change background colors to a more beautiful pallet).


FIXME:

1. Make demo data in guest user (json) always appear as this month + last month's data instead of specific months.
(so it's always presented as this month's and last month's data, not just a specific one)
2. Make demo data json use firestore timestamp.
3. Fix Home's month picker's width. Make it change size according to it's content.
